Welcome to Totally Not Cursed, a curated Minecraft modpack focused on atmospheric, survival-oriented gameplay with horror elements. It combines sanity mechanics, persistent stalking entities, tactical combat features, and modified world generation to create a challenging, immersive experience.

## üß† Psychological Effects & Sanity

The pack includes a sanity-style system that affects player perception and behavior. Lower sanity may cause unsettling audio/visual effects and alter how certain encounters play out. Managing resources, rest, and other in-game choices will influence your mental state.

## üëπ Persistent Stalking Entities

Several mods add intelligent, persistent threats that can track or ambush players. These entities use environment interaction and varied behaviors to create tension in both surface and underground areas. Their presence encourages cautious exploration and adaptive strategies.

## üéØ Tactical Combat Features

Combat includes mechanics inspired by tactical shooters: manual checking of gear, realistic weapon handling, and communication tools intended for coordinated play. These systems are aimed at increasing immersion and raising the stakes of combat encounters.

## üå´Ô∏è Atmospheric World and Audio

World generation and environment mods modify terrain, biomes, and structures to support a more atmospheric playstyle. Audio and ambient improvements help build tension and make exploration feel more impactful.

## ‚ú® Custom Extras Mod (Original Content)

This modpack includes a custom "extras" mod where we will add original content developed specifically for this pack. The extras mod will introduce bespoke items, encounters, or features that complement the existing horror-focused mods. We will keep the established horror mods and their behavior while using the extras mod to add unique, original content.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Intended Audience

This pack is for players who want survival-first horror ‚Äî not the jump-scare kind, but the slow, hungry kind that remembers your mistakes. It may not be for anyone. Yes, anyone: even veterans of other horror packs may find its pacing, scarcity, and persistent threats unforgiving. Expect to be stalked, out-resourced, and made to choose between bad options. If you crave tension, grit, and a world that punishes comfort, you'll fit in.
